# Chess Engine

Welcome to the Chess Engine project! This repository contains a custom-built chess engine capable of playing chess at a competitive level. Whether you're looking to challenge the engine, learn about AI-driven chess strategies, or explore the internals of a chess engine, this project is a great place to start.

## Features

- **Game Mechanics**: Implements all standard chess rules, including castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.
- **AI-Powered Engine**: Leverages advanced algorithms to calculate optimal moves.
- **Customizable Difficulty**: Adjust the engine's depth and performance to suit your skill level.
- **Move Validation**: Ensures that all moves comply with the rules of chess.
- **User Interface**: Play via a simple terminal-based interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Algorithms**: Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning
- **Libraries**:
  - `numpy` for efficient computations
  - `pygame` (optional) for GUI-based chessboard visualization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Navin2109/Chess-Engine.git
   cd Chess-Engine
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the engine:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Usage

1. Start the engine by running `main.py`.
2. Enter moves in standard algebraic notation (e.g., `e2e4`).
3. The engine will respond with its calculated move.

Optional: If `pygame` is installed, you can use a GUI for better visualization.

## How It Works

The chess engine uses the following techniques:

1. **Minimax Algorithm**: Evaluates possible moves by simulating the game tree.
2. **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Optimizes the Minimax algorithm by pruning suboptimal branches.
3. **Board Evaluation**: Uses a scoring system to evaluate board positions based on material, positioning, and other factors.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for new features, optimizations, or bug fixes, feel free to:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch.
3. Submit a pull request.

## Future Improvements

- Implement a neural network for move evaluation.
- Add support for multiplayer games.
- Enhance the GUI with `pygame` or other frameworks.
- Integrate an opening book for stronger play in the early game.

## Acknowledgments

- Inspiration from classic chess engines like Stockfish.
- Resources from chess programming forums and tutorials.
